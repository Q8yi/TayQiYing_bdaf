# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```


```shell
Under ignition\modules
Lab1.js
-> aims to receive PASS event emitted from OnsiteW2Lab1Flags

Lab2.js
-> aims to receive 1000 tokens from OnsiteW2Lab2Vault

Lab3.js
-> aims to create uniswap contract with 1 QyToken to 3 QyToken1
```
